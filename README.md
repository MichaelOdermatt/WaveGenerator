<h3>Wave Shape</h3>
<p>Uses Gerstner Waves and a layered noise map (Fractal Brownian Motion I think) to create the wave shape.

<h3>Whitecaps</h3>
<p>The whitecaps were created by taking the Y component of each surface normal, multiplying it by the normalized height of each associated vertex, then evaluating that value along a gradient.
